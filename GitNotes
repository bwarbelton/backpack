Because all files were pushed to Git there are some problems when running the web site on each developer laptop.

Go to project properties/java build path/libraries and change the web library if necessary
Go to project properties/project facets and change the java version to 1.7 or 1.8 if necessary

change the db settings in src/mybatisConfig if necessary.
